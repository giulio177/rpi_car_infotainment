# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The RPi Car Infotainment project has been successfully reorganized to improve maintainability and structure. Files have been moved from the root directory into appropriate subdirectories.

## New Directory Structure

```
rpi_car_infotainment/
├── assets/             # Icons and other static assets (unchanged)
├── backend/            # Backend functionality (unchanged)
├── deployment/         # Service files, installation scripts, and deployment configs (NEW)
├── gui/                # GUI components and screens (unchanged)
├── music/              # Music library and related files (unchanged)
├── scripts/            # Shell scripts and utilities (reorganized)
├── tests/              # Test files (unchanged)
├── tools/              # RF communication and other tools (renamed from rf_tools)
├── config.json         # Configuration file (unchanged)
├── main.py             # Main application entry point (unchanged)
└── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies (unchanged)
```

## Files Moved

### To `deployment/` directory:
- `*.service` files (rpi-infotainment.service, rpi-airplay.service, etc.)
- `*.desktop` files (rpi-car-infotainment.desktop, etc.)
- `install_*.sh` scripts (install_service.sh, install_airplay_service.sh)
- `bash_profile`
- `rc.local`
- `setup_runtime_dir.sh`

### To `scripts/` directory:
- `start_infotainment.sh`
- `start_airplay.sh`
- `clear-framebuffer.sh`
- Existing Python scripts (run_headless.py) remained

### Renamed directories:
- `rf_tools/` → `tools/`

## Files Updated

### Path References Updated:
1. **Service Files:**
   - `deployment/rpi-infotainment.service` - Updated ExecStart path
   - `deployment/rpi-airplay.service` - Updated ExecStart path
   - `deployment/setup-runtime.service` - Updated ExecStart path
   - `deployment/hide-console.service` - Updated ExecStart path

2. **Desktop Files:**
   - `deployment/rpi-car-infotainment.desktop` - Updated Exec path
   - `deployment/rpi-car-infotainment-system.desktop` - Updated Exec path

3. **Configuration Files:**
   - `deployment/bash_profile` - Updated script path

4. **Documentation:**
   - `README.md` - Updated project structure diagram and all command examples
   - `tools/__init__.py` - Updated package description

5. **Scripts:**
   - `scripts/start_infotainment.sh` - Updated to work from scripts directory

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Cleaner Root Directory:** Only essential files remain in the root
2. **Logical Grouping:** Related files are now grouped together
3. **Better Maintainability:** Easier to find and manage specific types of files
4. **Deployment Separation:** All deployment-related files are in one place
5. **Tool Organization:** RF tools and other utilities are properly categorized

## Usage After Reorganization

### Running the Application:
```bash
# From project root
python main.py

# Using start script
./scripts/start_infotainment.sh
```

### Installing Services:
```bash
# Install main service
sudo ./deployment/install_service.sh

# Install AirPlay service
sudo ./deployment/install_airplay_service.sh
```

### Using RF Tools:
```bash
# Send RF codes
python tools/send_code.py -c 12345 -g 24

# Receive RF codes
python tools/receive_code.py -g 23
```

## Files Removed:
- `=2.0.0` (pip install log file)

All functionality remains the same, but the project is now much better organized!
