echo "   - No separate windows or overlays"
echo
echo "🔧 **How It Works:**"
echo "   1. AirPlay starts X11 RPiPlay process"
echo "   2. When device connects → switches to video screen"
echo "   3. Video window is positioned in designated area"
echo "   4. Phone screen appears integrated in the UI"
echo "   5. Back/Stop buttons for easy navigation"
echo

echo "=== Expected User Experience ==="
echo
echo "1. **Start AirPlay:**"
echo "   - ✅ Go to AirPlay screen"
echo "   - ✅ Press 'Start AirPlay'"
echo "   - ✅ X server starts, device becomes discoverable"
echo "   - ✅ UI remains fully functional"
echo
echo "2. **Connect Device:**"
echo "   - ✅ Connect iPhone/iPad to 'Car Display'"
echo "   - ✅ **Automatically switches to video screen**"

echo "=== Monitoring Commands ==="
echo
echo "# Monitor window positioning:"
echo "DISPLAY=:0 xwininfo -root -tree | grep -i rpiplay"
echo
echo "# Monitor wmctrl operations:"
echo "DISPLAY=:0 wmctrl -l"
echo
echo "# Application logs:"
echo "journalctl -u rpi-infotainment.service -f"
echo
echo "# Check video area geometry:"
echo "# (Look for 'Video area geometry configured' in logs)"
echo

echo "=== Troubleshooting ==="
echo
echo "🔧 **If video doesn't appear in area:**"
echo "   - Check wmctrl is installed: which wmctrl"
echo "   - Check window positioning logs"
echo "   - Verify video area geometry is set"
echo "   - Check RPiPlay window is found"
echo
echo "🔧 **If screen doesn't switch automatically:**"
echo "   - Check connection detection in logs"
echo "   - Verify show_video_screen signal"
echo "   - Check AirPlay manager signals"
echo
echo "🔧 **If video area is wrong size:**"
echo "   - Check get_video_area_geometry method"
echo "   - Verify screen scaling calculations"
echo "   - Check window resize commands"
echo

echo "=== Current Status ==="
echo
echo "Main App: $(pgrep -f "python3 main.py" > /dev/null && echo "✅ Running (PID: $(pgrep -f "python3 main.py"))" || echo "❌ Not running")"
