echo "=== New Safe AirPlay Mode ==="
echo
echo "🎯 **How the Safe Mode Works:**"
echo
echo "1. **No Display Takeover:**"
echo "   - AirPlay starts in audio-only mode"
echo "   - No X server is started"
echo "   - Qt UI remains fully visible and functional"
echo "   - No black screen issues"
echo
echo "2. **Device Discovery:**"
echo "   - Device becomes discoverable as 'Car Display'"
echo "   - Supports audio streaming"
echo "   - Video mirroring is disabled to prevent conflicts"
echo
echo "3. **Connection Handling:**"
echo "   - When device connects, shows info overlay"
echo "   - Overlay explains the current mode"
echo "   - Provides option to stop AirPlay"
echo "   - UI remains accessible underneath"
echo
echo "4. **No Freezing:**"
echo "   - No display conflicts"
echo "   - No black screens"
echo "   - No system freezes"
echo "   - Clean disconnection handling"
echo

echo "=== Test Instructions ==="
echo
echo "📋 **Test Case 1: Start AirPlay**"
echo "   1. Go to AirPlay screen in car infotainment"
echo "   2. Press 'Start AirPlay'"
echo "   3. ✅ UI should remain visible (no black screen)"
echo "   4. ✅ Device should become discoverable"
echo "   5. ✅ No X server should start"
echo
echo "📋 **Test Case 2: Connect Device**"
echo "   1. Connect iPhone/iPad to 'Car Display'"
echo "   2. ✅ Audio streaming should work"
echo "   3. ✅ Info overlay should appear"
echo "   4. ✅ UI should remain accessible"
echo "   5. ✅ No video mirroring (by design)"
echo
echo "📋 **Test Case 3: Disconnect Device**"
echo "   1. Disconnect device from AirPlay"
echo "   2. ✅ Overlay should disappear"
echo "   3. ✅ UI should return to normal"
echo "   4. ✅ No freezing or black screen"
echo
echo "📋 **Test Case 4: Stop AirPlay**"
echo "   1. Use 'Stop AirPlay' button (in overlay or AirPlay screen)"
echo "   2. ✅ AirPlay should stop cleanly"
echo "   3. ✅ Device should no longer be discoverable"
echo "   4. ✅ UI should remain functional"
echo

echo "=== Benefits of Safe Mode ==="
echo
echo "✅ **No Display Conflicts** - Qt UI always visible"
echo "✅ **No Black Screens** - No X server interference"
echo "✅ **No System Freezes** - Clean process management"
echo "✅ **Audio Streaming** - Still provides AirPlay functionality"
echo "✅ **Stable Operation** - Reliable start/stop cycles"
echo "✅ **User Control** - Clear feedback and control options"
echo

echo "=== Monitoring Commands ==="
echo
echo "# Monitor application logs:"
echo "journalctl -u rpi-infotainment.service -f"
echo
echo "# Monitor AirPlay process:"
echo "watch 'ps aux | grep rpiplay | grep -v grep'"
echo
echo "# Check for X server (should not start):"
echo "ps aux | grep 'X.*:0' | grep -v grep"
echo
echo "# Monitor network discovery:"
echo "avahi-browse -t _airplay._tcp"
echo

echo "=== Current Status ==="
echo
echo "Main App: $(pgrep -f "python3 main.py" > /dev/null && echo "✅ Running (PID: $(pgrep -f "python3 main.py"))" || echo "❌ Not running")"
echo "RPiPlay:  $(pgrep -f "rpiplay" > /dev/null && echo "✅ Running (PID: $(pgrep -f "rpiplay"))" || echo "❌ Not running (normal - starts when needed)")"
echo "X Server: $(pgrep -f "X.*:0" > /dev/null && echo "⚠️ Running (unexpected)" || echo "✅ Not running (correct)")"

echo
echo "🚀 **Safe Mode Ready!**"
echo "   Go to AirPlay screen and test the new safe mode!"
echo "   No more black screens or freezing! 🎉"
